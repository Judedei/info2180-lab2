                    <h2>The Inevitability of L's.</h2>
                    <p style="color: #718096">October 1, 2021 by Juddy-Shae Wallace</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Have you ever lost something before? I know right? Of course you have! There isn't
                            a single human on this earth who can attest to never having
                            lost something. Hopefully for you, it's something replaceable because the impact of loss never truly hits home until we realize how invaluable it was.
                            The sad thing is, loss isn't just limited to physical possessions.
                        </p>

                        <img src= "peace.png" alt="John 14:27 : Peace I leave with you; my peace I give to you.
                                Not as the world gives do I give to you. Let not your hearts be troubled, neither let them be afraid." style="float:right;width:50%;height:50%; padding:10px; border-radius: 0px 0px 0px 0px">

                       <p>Over the course of our lives, we will lose our innocence as we venture
                            along the path of life. We will also lose our youthfulness; others will lose their
                            health, their teeth; others will lose their figure, hair, and sight; but what's common
                            to all is that we must lose someone. Whether a parent; a partner; a friend or foe; we all must go.
                            The mistake that a lot of us make is that we dread the dark unknown, because ever since birth we have
                            only known how to exist. If we are blessed, we may live to see 70, which seems like a long time for us;
                            but to other creatures, its hardly any time at all.  Take, for example, turtles and tortoises or even trees.
                            They are mortal like us, they know they must die but they do not dread the loss nor the passing.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>It's true, however; that there is much to fear in death; and since we can not avoid it, we can derive from it a lesson.
                            We won't live forever, and the time we have is much too short. Death and loss help us to appreciate what we would have taken for granted
                            if it were not so. The great equaliser is out for everyone, but a life well lived is a life well loved.</p>

                    <p> Life is filled with irreplaceable memories. From one's first birthday, to great accomplishments, i.e., graduating college, 
                        there's still so much we have to be thankful for just by being alive. 
                        Every breath we inhale, food we eat, or rest we take is a gift from above, 
                        especially in these uncertain times.</p>
            
                    <p>You are your forever home and there will be another like you, so relax if you can. Did you know that there was a 1 in a 400 trillion
                        chance of you being here? That's crazy, right? and if you aren't serving up some Vitamin S (Vitamin smiles), now's the time to start.
                        You and I are extraordinary in our own rights, perfected by the hands of the potter, and 1001% unique. That alone is enough to smile
                        about. Unfortunately, life can be very hard right now given the state of the world, but for as long as we are alive, things can improve. 
                        So take a rest, give yourself a pat on the back, you are exactly where you need to be right now. 
                        Remember, everyday is filled with choices; a choice to heal, a choice to love, a choice to grow, and a choice to change. It's up to us
                        to carve out what we want for ourselves, but please try to remember: one of the greatest things to possess is your intrinsic uniqueness.
